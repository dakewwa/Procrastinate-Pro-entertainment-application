## Description
Procrastinate Pro+ Entertainment App Business Performance Analysis" project
In this project, we will analyze data about users, their activity, orders, and advertising costs to understand the reasons for unprofitability and help the company turn a profit.

## Conclusion
The reasons for the ineffectiveness of user acquisition are as follows:

US users stopped paying off when advertising costs (CAC) skyrocketed. This has led to lower ROI despite the high "lifetime value" (LTV) of these users.
Little attention is paid to PC owners, who, however, retained better than others and paid off by the end of the second week.
Retention of paying users from the US was worse than users from other countries.
Users coming from Tiptop and Facebook channels did not pay off due to high advertising costs.
Users from Facebook and AdNoneSense channels retained worse than others.
Recommendations for the marketing department:

Focus on attracting PC users as they show better retention and ROI.
Focus on attracting users with Android devices.
Reduce marketing spend in the U.S. due to ineffective engagement from that region.
Invest in attracting users from Lambda channels, which may be more effective in terms of ROI.
Reduce advertising spend in Facebook and AdNoneSense channels due to low retention and ROI.
